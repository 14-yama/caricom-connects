# Client Vetting Process

To ensure that our procurement services are accessed by clients who have the ability to pay and are committed to our terms and conditions, we have established the following vetting process:

1. **Registration Form**: Prospective clients must fill out a registration form on our website. This form collects basic information such as name, email address, company name (if applicable), phone number, and business type.

2. **Payment Method Verification**: Clients are required to provide information about their preferred payment method, which must be either credit card or bank transfer. We verify the authenticity of this information by cross-referencing it with the details provided during registration.

3. **Confirmation of Payment Ability**: We communicate with the client to confirm their ability to pay for our services using the accepted payment methods (credit card or bank transfer). This may involve a brief phone call or email exchange to ensure clarity.

4. **Bank Fees Agreement**: Clients must agree to pay any bank fees associated with credit card payments or bank transfers. This ensures that all transaction costs are covered by the client.

5. **Elite Membership Consideration (If Applicable)**: For clients interested in becoming elite members with cash payment privileges, we may conduct additional vetting steps such as requesting financial statements, references from financial institutions, or proof of past payment reliability.

6. **Acceptance of Membership Agreement**: Once the vetting process is complete, approved clients must review and agree to our membership agreement or terms of service. This agreement outlines the payment terms, service levels, and other relevant details. Clients must upload a signature as confirmation of their agreement.

7. **Account Activation**: Upon acceptance of the membership agreement and receipt of the uploaded signature, we activate the client's account and grant them access to our procurement services.

By implementing this vetting process, we ensure that our procurement services are accessible to clients who are financially capable and willing to abide by our terms and conditions.
