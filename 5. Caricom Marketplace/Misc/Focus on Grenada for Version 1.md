### Focus on Grenada for Version 1.0 Trade Platform

Given the immediate opportunity in Grenada to connect farmers with buyers through the trade platform, it makes sense to prioritize Grenada for the initial version (Version 1.0) of the platform. By focusing on Grenada initially, you can streamline the development process, gather valuable feedback from users, and establish a strong foundation for future expansion to other islands like St. Vincent.

However, it's essential to keep the broader vision of connecting farmers and traders across the Caricom region in mind during the design and development phase. While Version 1.0 may focus primarily on Grenada, you can incorporate scalability and flexibility into the platform's architecture to facilitate expansion to other islands in subsequent versions.

In summary, start with Grenada for Version 1.0 to capitalize on the immediate opportunity, but design the platform with the flexibility to accommodate future expansion to other islands like St. Vincent as your business grows and matures.
