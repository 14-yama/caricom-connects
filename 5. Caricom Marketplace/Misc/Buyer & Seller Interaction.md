Here's how the transaction would occur in the CRM system using the approach of treating sellers as vendors and buyers as customers:

1. **Registration Process:**

   - Anthony McBurnie, the farmer, accesses the Caricom Connects platform for the first time.
   - He navigates to the registration page and signs up as a seller by providing his basic information, such as name, email, and location.
   - Upon submission, his registration details are captured by the portal and stored as a new vendor record in Method CRM.

2. **Profile Setup:**

   - After registration, Anthony sets up his seller profile by entering additional details, such as farm name, product categories, and contact information.
   - He uploads photos and descriptions of his agricultural products, specifying quantities, prices, and other relevant details.
   - These product listings are stored as vendor inventory records in Method CRM and associated with Anthony's vendor profile.

3. **Product Listing:**

   - Anthony selects the option to list his agricultural products on the Caricom Connects platform.
   - He enters the product details, including names, descriptions, images, prices, and available quantities, through the portal interface.
   - Once submitted, this information is synchronized with Anthony's vendor record in Method CRM, updating his inventory and product listings accordingly.

4. **Visibility to Buyers:**

   - Anthony's listings become visible to buyers in Trinidad and other regions served by Caricom Connects.
   - Buyers can browse the platform, view Anthony's products, and place orders directly through the portal.

5. **Order Processing:**

   - When a buyer from Trinidad places an order for Anthony's produce, the transaction details are captured by the portal.
   - The order information, including product details, quantities, and buyer information, is recorded as a new sales order in Method CRM.
   - Anthony receives a notification of the new order through the portal and prepares the products for shipment.

6. **Fulfillment and Delivery:**

   - Anthony fulfills the order by packaging the products and arranging for shipment to the buyer in Trinidad.
   - He updates the order status in the portal, indicating that the products have been dispatched for delivery.
   - As the order progresses, shipping and tracking information can be added to the sales order record in Method CRM, providing visibility to both Anthony and the buyer.

7. **Completion and Feedback:**
   - Once the buyer receives the products and confirms satisfaction, the order is marked as complete in the portal.
   - Anthony receives payment for the sale, and the transaction details are recorded in Method CRM, updating his sales history and financial records.
   - Both Anthony and the buyer have the option to leave feedback and ratings, which can inform future transactions and build trust within the Caricom Connects community.
