## Insights into Caricom Trade Dynamics

1. **B2B Relationships and Monopolies:**

   - Major brands have established B2B relationships between islands, with some islands relying heavily on others for specific goods.
   - Small traders visit Trinidad to source goods for wholesale or retail purposes, with a monopoly on the exchange of goods between islands.

2. **Opportunity in Grenada:**

   - With the closure of a company that previously bought agriculture produce for export, local farmers in Grenada need alternative means to sell their goods.
   - Caricom Connects can fill this gap by connecting Grenadian farmers with buyers in other islands, leveraging existing relationships and networks.

3. **Export Opportunity in St. Vincent:**

   - St. Vincent has a reputation for exporting bananas and plantains to Trinidad, but other potential markets remain untapped.
   - Caricom Connects can explore opportunities to connect St. Vincent farmers with buyers in other islands, expanding their market reach and increasing export potential.

4. **Challenges in Guyana:**

   - Guyana is a major player in agriculture volume export within Caricom, but transit time to Trinidad poses a challenge.
   - Caricom Connects can investigate solutions to streamline transportation logistics and reduce transit time, enabling Guyanese farmers to access markets more efficiently.

5. **Engagement with Stakeholders:**
   - The manager of the company in Grenada can serve as a valuable advisor or director for Caricom Connects, providing insights and guidance based on her experience and expertise.
   - Engage with stakeholders in St. Vincent and Guyana to understand their specific needs and explore opportunities for collaboration.

By addressing these challenges and leveraging existing relationships and networks, Caricom Connects can play a significant role in driving integration, fostering collaboration, and empowering individuals and communities across the Caricom region.
