Treating each seller as a vendor and each buyer as a customer within Method CRM can be a viable solution to bypass the need for individual user accounts for sellers. This approach simplifies user management and eliminates the need for sellers to have dedicated Method CRM accounts.

Here's how this approach could work:

1. **Seller Management as Vendors:**

   - Each seller is treated as a vendor within Method CRM. Their profile information, inventory, and product details are stored as vendor records in the CRM system.
   - Sellers can log in to the portal to update their inventory, product information, pricing, and other relevant details. These updates are synced with their corresponding vendor records in Method CRM.

2. **Buyer Management as Customers:**

   - Each buyer is treated as a customer within Method CRM. Their profile information, purchase history, and transaction details are stored as customer records in the CRM system.
   - Buyers can log in to the portal to browse products, place orders, view order history, and manage their account information. These interactions are recorded as customer activities in Method CRM.

3. **Syncing Inventory and Product Information:**

   - The portal interface allows sellers to manage their inventory and product information conveniently. Any updates made by sellers in the portal are automatically synced with their vendor records in Method CRM.
   - Buyers can view updated product listings, prices, and availability in real-time through the portal, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

4. **Transaction Management:**

   - When buyers place orders through the portal, the transactions are processed and recorded in Method CRM. Each order is associated with the respective seller (vendor) and buyer (customer) records.
   - Sellers receive notifications of new orders and can fulfill them accordingly. Transaction details, including order status, payment information, and shipping details, are tracked within Method CRM.

5. **Reporting and Analysis:**
   - Method CRM provides comprehensive reporting and analysis capabilities, allowing you to track sales performance, inventory levels, customer behavior, and other key metrics.
   - By leveraging Method CRM's reporting tools, you can gain insights into your trade platform's operations, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize performance.

Overall, treating sellers as vendors and buyers as customers within Method CRM simplifies user management and streamlines transaction processing while still providing robust inventory management and reporting capabilities. This approach aligns with your goal of avoiding the need for individual user accounts for sellers and facilitates efficient operation of your trade platform.
