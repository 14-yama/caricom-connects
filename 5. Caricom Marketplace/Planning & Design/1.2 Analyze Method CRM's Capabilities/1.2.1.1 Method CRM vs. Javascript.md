In the Caricom Connects portal, both Method CRM and the JavaScript website will play essential roles, but they will handle different aspects of the platform.

The heavy lifting in terms of managing trade transactions, customer relationships, and business processes will likely be done by Method CRM. Method CRM specializes in customer relationship management, lead tracking, opportunity management, and case management. It will handle tasks such as:

- Managing seller accounts and product listings.
- Tracking leads and opportunities generated from buyer inquiries.
- Managing trade transactions, including order processing, invoicing, and payment tracking.
- Providing customer support and case management functionalities to address customer inquiries and issues.
- Integrating with backend systems and databases to synchronize data and streamline business processes.

On the other hand, the JavaScript website will handle frontend development and user interface design, focusing on aspects such as:

- Designing and developing the user interface of the portal to ensure a user-friendly experience for buyers and sellers.
- Implementing product listings, search functionality, and shopping cart features to facilitate product discovery and purchasing.
- Managing user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Implementing real-time communication features, such as messaging and notifications, to facilitate interaction between buyers and sellers.
- Integrating with third-party services and APIs for additional functionalities, such as payment processing and analytics.

While both Method CRM and the JavaScript website are critical components of the Caricom Connects portal, Method CRM will handle the backend processes and data management, while the JavaScript website will focus on frontend development and user interaction.
