   - Reach out to buyers through targeted marketing campaigns, industry associations, and networking events to promote the benefits of the platform.
   - Highlight the advantages of sourcing fresh, high-quality produce directly from farmers, along with the transparency and efficiency of the Tridge business model.
   - Facilitate meetings and negotiations between buyers and farmers to establish mutually beneficial partnerships and transactions.

3. **Caricom Connects:**
